            <p>I an Enterprise Cloud engineer at Safaricom PLC. Currently, I am enrolled at Moringa Schoool as a software engineer student.</p>
            <p>I studied Telecommunication and Information Engineering from Dedan Kimathi University and graduated in the year 2017</p>
            <p>Since my graduation, I have worked in various ISPs at different capacities including Technical Support role, IP support engineer, 
                Field deployment engineer and the most recent Cloud infrastructure engineer at Safaricom PLC</p>
            <p>I decided to join Moringa School to sharpen my development skills so as to be able to merge the skills gained into my daily cloud operations.
                I am aiming to automate cloud operations and activities from the skills gained in this programme.
